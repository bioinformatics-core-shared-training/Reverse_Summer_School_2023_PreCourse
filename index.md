2. [Install the `tidyverse` R package (necessary for both workshops)](Precourse_Instructions.html#installing-the-tidyverse-r-package)
2. [Install the necessary R packages for the RNAseq workshop, if you are attending](Precourse_Instructions.html#installing-packages-for-the-differential-gene-expression-analysis-workshop)
3. [Download the necessary data for the workshops](Precourse_Instructions.html#installing-packages-for-the-differential-gene-expression-analysis-workshop)

The documents linked above contain instructions for carrying out each of tasks.
